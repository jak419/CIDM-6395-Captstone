# What I Learnt?
In the 2 Networking and Cybersecurity courses I took towards my degree at WTA&M, I have gained extensive knowledge and practical understanding with regards to networking fundamentals, cybersecurity risk management, and vulnerability assessment techniques. I learned about network discovery, security auditing tools, packet capturing, vulnerability scanning, and cybersecurity planning and policy development. 
In Networking and Cybersecurity Course 1, I explored foundational cybersecurity topics such as breach detection tools, network surveys, wireless security, phishing threat mitigation, and information security policies. For instance, I used the website https://www.grc.com/ to assess exposure to cyber incidents, and I performed a wireless security survey combined with a phishing campaign simulation to evaluate vulnerabilities in my personal cybersecurity practices. Additionally, I developed a robust information security policy understanding the components of strong organizational security management. These improved my ability to systematically approach security through clearly defined protocols and actionable security policies.
In Networking and Cybersecurity Course 2, my competencies were significantly expanded through hands-on usage of advanced security tools such as Nmap, Wireshark, and Nessus. Using Nmap, I conducted in-depth network mapping identifying live devices, active ports, and security vulnerabilities on my home network. I was able to demonstrate my ability to analyze network structures and identify potential points of exploitation. Wireshark enabled me to deeply analyze network packets, observe unencrypted HTTP vulnerabilities, and reinforce the importance of encryption. I also conducted thorough vulnerability assessments using Shields Up and Nessus, discovering exposed ports, outdated software, encryption vulnerabilities, and misconfigured systems. Through practical application, I also gained competency in developing detailed security audits, exemplified by my thorough audit of Uptown Dental Associates, where I evaluated physical security, password policies, network infrastructure, and regulatory compliance according to HIPAA standards.

# Supporting Evidence
I was able to translate all these competencies into multiple research papers I worked on. For instance, mapping network using Nmap which revealed devices, active services, and security risks in my home network. The Wireshark network analysis provided deep insights into unencrypted data exposure and the necessity of secure data transmission protocols. The Shields Up and Nessus vulnerability assessments enabled me to thoroughly identify and prioritize vulnerabilities, leading to actionable strategies for mitigation and prevention. Additionally, my comprehensive security audit conducted for Uptown Dental Associates exemplifies my practical capabilities, attention to detail, and ability to develop strategic recommendations aimed at enhancing cybersecurity posture and regulatory compliance.

# Weaknesses
There are certain areas that I think still present opportunities for improvement. My practical experience in managing advanced firewall configurations, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) is limited. Although I've identified vulnerabilities using Nessus and Shields Up, direct hands-on experience with remediation techniques at enterprise-scale environments remains limited. Another weakness is in-depth understanding and practical implementation of advanced network configuration techniques, such as network segmentation, VLAN setups, and dynamic routing configurations. Although I've gained theoretical insights into these areas, additional practical experience would significantly strengthen my proficiency. 
Also, my experience with advanced threat detection and incident response methodologies, including real-time threat monitoring, threat hunting, and comprehensive incident response handling, remains limited. These areas require more practical exposure to enhance my preparedness for real-world scenarios. My familiarity with regulatory compliance frameworks such as HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI DSS is primarily conceptual; additional experience applying these regulations practically to specific scenarios would further develop my capabilities in cybersecurity compliance management.

# What I Wish I knew
Firstly, I wish to deepen my knowledge in cybersecurity incident response methodologies, including hands-on training with real-time incident detection and response platforms such as Splunk, QRadar, or Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools. Such skills would allow me to effectively manage cybersecurity incidents in a timely and efficient manner.  Additionally, practical experience with cloud-based security environments such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform would greatly improve my skills, especially given the increasing reliance on cloud solutions. Knowledge of cloud-native security tools, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and cloud security posture management (CSPM) solutions would enable me to better secure modern computing environments. Another significant area I'd like to explore further is penetration testing and ethical hacking. Understanding offensive cybersecurity tactics and penetration testing tools (e.g., Metasploit, Burp Suite) would empower me to proactively identify vulnerabilities and strengthen defense mechanisms before they are exploited by malicious actors.

# Capstone and Future Integration
Moving forward, the skills I've developed in Networking and Cybersecurity will integrate strongly with Data Analytics, Data Management, and Software Systems Development. For instance, knowledge gained from cybersecurity audits and vulnerability assessments enhances my understanding of data security, directly supporting data analytics and data management efforts. My experience in network analysis, packet capturing, and vulnerability scanning can ensure the data pipelines, web applications, and analytics solutions I build are inherently secure and robust.
