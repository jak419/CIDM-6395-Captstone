# What I Know
Taking courses BUS INTEL & DS SYS (CIDM 5310) and SEM DATA/ANALYTICS (CIDM 6308) which comprises of Data Analytics 1 and 2 courses at WT, I have gained substantial experience and proficiency in tools and techniques that are essential for data-driven decision-making. My work with Power BI stands out as one of my strongest skills, where I have created dynamic dashboards that visualizes complex datasets but also provide actionable insights for stakeholders. The process of designing these dashboards in this course demonstrated how I can establish connection between Power BI and to other data sources, performing data transformations, and applying advanced DAX calculations to create interactive and user-friendly reports. This hands-on experience has refined my ability to present complex data in an accessible manner.
In addition to Power BI, my exploration of Machine Learning (ML & AI) allowed me to implement algorithms for data analysis and trend prediction. I worked on real-world datasets, applying models like linear regression, decision trees, and clustering algorithms to uncover patterns and inform decisions. My understanding of data pipelines and ETL processes has also grown, as I designed workflows for extracting raw data from multiple sources, transforming it into a structured format, and loading it into data warehouses for analysis. This combination of skills has solidified my competence in handling large datasets efficiently.
Similarly, in Data Analytics Course 2, I enhanced my programming skills in Python, where I performed extensive data manipulation and cleansing. Writing Python scripts to clean messy datasets, handle missing values, and prepare data for advanced analysis. My coursework included building machine learning models such as logistic regression, KNN, and K-Means clustering, which helped me understand the importance of selecting the right algorithm for each problem. I also gained experience in model evaluation and validation, though I recognize that mastering model selection is an area where I need to improve.


# Supporting Evidence
Evidence for skills acquired are loaded into my GitHub repository.  The Vehicle Sales Prediction project  (https://github.com/jak419/CIDM-6305) showcases my ability to integrate Azure AutoML for training machine learning models and leverage Power BI for creating insightful visualizations. In the Credit Card Approval Prediction project (https://github.com/jak419/Supervised-Machine-Learning-Project-Predicting-Credit-Card-Approval), I utilized logistic regression to predict credit card approvals, demonstrating my ability to handle classification problems and preprocess data effectively. Additionally, the Song Classification project (https://github.com/jak419/Supervised-ML-Song-classification) highlights my use of decision tree classifiers and logistic regression, further emphasizing my machine learning capabilities.
Each of these projects required thorough research, data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation, illustrating my analytical approach and problem-solving abilities.


# Weaknesses
In Data Analytics Course 1, my weaknesses include limited experience with Microsoft Azure, which I aim to improve. Additionally, while I have worked with Power BI, I still find challenges in optimizing complex DAX queries and ensuring data model efficiency. In Data Analytics Course 2, I need to strengthen my understanding of model selection, as choosing the best model is crucial for accurate predictions. My experience with large datasets and optimization techniques also needs refinement.


# What I Wish I Knew
While I have gained substantial skills, I recognize there are areas I wish I knew more about. Advanced machine learning algorithms such as ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch are aspects I aim to explore. Additionally, I wish to deepen my understanding of cloud-based data engineering tools beyond Azure, such as AWS and Google Cloud. Gaining exposure to data ethics and governance would also enhance my ability to manage data responsibly.


# Areas for Improvement
While I have a solid foundation in data analytics, I aim to improve my proficiency in Microsoft Azure, particularly in deploying machine learning models and managing cloud-based data services. Additionally, enhancing my knowledge of model selection techniques is essential because selecting the most suitable model can significantly impact the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis projects. I also seek to strengthen my skills in advanced Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for more efficient data manipulation and complex analysis. Another area for improvement is that I aim to explore big data tools such as Spark and Hadoop, which are increasingly essential in handling large-scale datasets in modern enterprises.


# Future Applications
The knowledge and skills I have acquired position me well for tackling real-world data analytics challenges. My ability to build interactive dashboards, develop robust machine learning models, and manage data pipelines equips me to contribute effectively to any data-driven organization. As I currently work as a data engineer, these courses have provided me with foundational knowledge that enhances my ability to design, build, and optimize data architectures, automate data workflows, and ensure data quality. Moving forward, I am eager to apply these competencies in my capstone project, where I will integrate data analytics. My portfolio will feature comprehensive case studies, detailed documentation, and code repositories, demonstrating my readiness for professional roles in data analytics and my capacity to deliver impactful solutions. Additionally, the integration of these skills supports my current role by enabling me to leverage machine learning for predictive analytics, use Power BI for reporting, and improve data processing pipelines for more efficient operations.
