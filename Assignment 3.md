# What I Learnt?
In the systems development curriculum particularly in Systems Development Courses 1 and 2 I have taken in this program has helped me built a solid foundation in several important areas within software and systems development. Throughout Systems Development Course 1, I gained technical competences in programming languages such as python, SQL, HTML and CSS.  I learned and refined my programming skills in Python, gaining proficiency in essential programming concepts, including modular and object-oriented programming, error handling, and effective use of data structures and algorithms. Additionally, I explored web development, using HTML and CSS to create web interfaces. This enhanced my ability to build user-friendly and accessible web applications. 
In Systems Development Course 2, I was able to put all this knowledge together focusing on the principles of software engineering and architecture to develop application using the Django Framework. My experience in this course allowed me to understand the complexities involved in software design and architecture, software engineering principles, and the importance of creating robust and maintainable software systems. A significant strength from this course was my practical experience in building fully functional web applications using Django. This project integrated frontend and backend systems, managing databases through Django's ORM, and effectively handling requests and responses within a structured framework.
The core competencies from these two courses were enormous. Through skills acquired from python programming and software development, I was able to develop python-based application modular and object-oriented programming principles. The application was robust with error handling, unit testing and code refactoring. Competencies were gained in web development particularly in HTML, CSSS and the Django framework. I was able to develop a web application using Django framework, applied HTML, CSS and used JavaScript to create interactive user interfaces. The next competency developed was with SQL and database management. I developed ER diagrams to structure database schemas effectively. This was implemented in designing of relational database paying head to best data normalization and query optimization best practices. Another competency that was developed was version control and collaboration using GitHub. All the projects I worked on, GitHub was utilized for version control and collaboration. I learnt how to implement branching, merging and pull requests which all fosters collaborative work.

# Supporting Evidence
I was able to translate all these competencies into the Online Sales System project I did in Systems Development Course 2 which can be found at the following gilt repo: https://github.com/jak419/django_project. This project exemplifies the competency in building end-to-end web applications using Django, Python, HTML, and CSS. In this project, I constructed a robust platform featuring product management, customer interactions, and order processing. The Django framework was leveraged extensively to manage user authentication, dynamic product listings, and order tracking functionalities. The integration of WebSockets in the Online Sales System project showcases my ability to implement real-time communication, which enables instant notifications and live updates within the user interface. Also, my use of SQL databases for persistent data storage, retrieval, and management demonstrates proficiency in relational database design, query optimization, and maintaining data integrity through database normalization. Lastly, I demonstrated one of software engineering best practices, version control, by employing git to manage versions of my code.

# Weaknesses
Despite my strengths in the foundational aspects of software development, I recognize several weaknesses that I intend to address. My experience with advanced software testing techniques remains limited. In Systems Development Course 2, I performed basic unit testing but I lack extensive practice with automated integration testing, load testing, and other advanced methodologies that ensure scalability and performance. Additionally, my exposure to comprehensive software engineering practices, particularly regarding continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), has been minimal.

# What I Wish I knew
I wish to enhance my skills in software architecture by learning and acquiring deeper expertise in microservices and distributed computing solutions. The knowledge from this field will allow me to design and implement more scalable and efficient software applications. I also recognized the importance of being proficient in containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. These are industry standard tools used for deploying, scaling and managing software applications in cloud environments. Also, acquiring proficiency in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices, particularly utilizing tools such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions, would enhance my productivity and efficiency in the software development lifecycle.

# Capstone Integration
My ability to create Python-based applications integrated with SQL databases and robust web frameworks such as Django will serve as a foundation for my capstone project, if I plan to develop comprehensive applications capable of processing and analyzing data securely. I am particularly confident in my ability to leverage these skills to build sophisticated systems that incorporate data-driven decision-making, optimized data workflows, and robust software architecture.
